Getting started
===============

This section describes how to setup an instance of shepherd in a tethered setup.

Prerequisites
-------------

To setup an instance of shepherd, you'll need to assemble a number of shepherd nodes.

For each shepherd node, you'll need:

* BeagleBone (Green/Black)
* shepherd cape

  * for recording: harvesting transducer, e.g. solar capelet and solar cell
  * for emulation: target capelet

In addition, you'll need at least one SD-card with at least 4GB capacity.

For the cape and capelets take a look at the `hardware design files <https://github.com/orgua/shepherd/tree/master/hardware>`_.
Shepherd version 2 hardware is currently under development, see the separate `repository <https://github.com/orgua/shepherd_v2_planning/tree/master/PCBs>`_.
The capelets can mostly be soldered by hand (except the target pcb).
The shepherd cape has a large number of small components and we suggest to send it to a PCB fab for assembly.

If you don't have the necessary resource or need assistance with getting the hardware manufactured, get in touch with the developers.

To connect the shepherd nodes to each other for control, data collection and time-synchronization, you need to setup an Ethernet network.
The network should be as flat as possible, i.e. have a minimum number of switches. This prevents possible trouble and also improves time synchronization with ptp. For sub 1 us offsets a hardware accelerated switch (like the Cisco Catalyst Series) is beneficial.
By default, the BeagleBone Ubuntu image is configured to request an IP address by DHCP.
Therefore your network should have a DHCP server.

Hardware setup
--------------

Stack the cape on top of the BeagleBone. The two 23x2 headers of the cape plug into the BeagleBone (P8 and P9).
Stack the harvesting capelet on top of the shepherd cape. The capelet is left-aligned on the same 23x2, but using just two 11x2 headers. Pay attention to the 2x2 header P6 (on the cape) for the correct orientation.

Stack the target capelet on top of the shepherd cape. The cape offers two ports P10 and P11 on the right side, also labeled as A & B.

Provide all BeagleBones with power through the micro USB ports and connect their Ethernet ports to an Ethernet switch.
Using a PoE switch and corresponding micro USB power splitters can greatly reduce the cabling requirements. These can introduce noise into the system though.
Same applies to the power-output of the Beaglebone. Therefore the cape offers an additional power-input in the lower left corner. It is able to power the whole shepherd node.
**Make sure** the jumper near the power terminal J1 is set according to the input source (up for micro USB, down by power terminal).

The DHCP server and your machine (for installation/control) must be connected to the same network.


Installation
------------

Prepare the SD-cards.
If you plan to install the OS and shepherd software on the onboard EMMC flash, you can prepare one SD card and sequentially flash the nodes.
If you plan to install the OS and shepherd software on SD card, you have to prepare one SD card for every shepherd node.
Depending on your choice, follow `the official instructions <https://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu#eMMC:_All_BeagleBone_Variants_with_eMMC>`_ for **BeagleBone**.
Shepherd has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (image updated 2020-03-12), but might work with other Debian based distributions.

After installing the OS on the BeagleBones and booting them, find out their IP addresses.
If you know the subnet, you can use nmap from your machine, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    nmap 192.168.178.0/24

Clone the shepherd repository to your machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/orgua/shepherd.git


Add an inventory file in the `inventory` folder in the repository, assigning hostnames to the IP addresses of the shepherd nodes.
Just start by editing the provided `inventory/herd.yml` example.
Pick a username that you want to use to login to the nodes and assign as `ansible_user` variable.
[**TODO:** update description with roles].

.. code-block:: yaml

    sheep:
      hosts:
        sheep0:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.100
        sheep1:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.101
        sheep2:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.102
      vars:
        ansible_user: jane

We'll use `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_ to roll out a basic configuration to the nodes.
This includes setting the hostname, adding the user, allowing password-less ssh access and sudo without password.
Make sure that you have `Python >=3.6`, `pip` and `sshpass` installed on your machine.
Install `Ansible` with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install ansible

Navigate to the root-directory of the cloned shepherd-project.
Now run the *bootstrap* `Ansible playbook <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html>`_ using the previously prepared inventory file:

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-playbook deploy/bootstrap.yml

To streamline the installation and upgrading process, the shepherd software is packaged and distributed as debian packages.
Installing is as easy as adding the shepherd repository to the aptitude sources and installing the shepherd metapackage.
[**TODO:** install by debian packages is partly deprecated, will be succeeded by ansible-playbook].
The *install* playbook allows to easily automate this process on a group of nodes.

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-playbook deploy/deploy.yml

On success, the nodes will reboot and should be ready for use, for example, using the *shepherd-herd* command line utility.

Further playbooks:

    - ``setup_linux_configuration.yml`` will handle updates, some configuration, remove clutter, improve ram-usage and boot-duration
    - ``setup_linux_performance.yml`` handles additional speed-improving changes
    - ``fetch-hostkeys.yml`` will copy keys from nodes, handy for reflashing image, while keeping keys
    - ``setup_pwdless_ssh_for_host.yml`` will deposit your machines' certificates on the nodes for future passwordless login
    - ``setup-dev-nfs.yml`` establish a local network file system ``/opt/shepherd-dev`` for the nodes to access
    - ``setup-ext-storage.yml`` will format and automount sd-card to ''/var/shepherd/recordings''
    - ``dev_rebuild_pru.yml`` hot-swaps pru-firmware (& kernel-module & py-package) by compiling and flashing without restart
